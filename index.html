  <p>The three most populous countries in the world are China, India, and the United States. China and India's population far exceed that of the United States. Considering that China, before 2022, was the long-time largest country in the world (by population), it is expected that its unemployment rates would far exceed that of India and the United States. However, this is not the case.</p>

  <p>From 2013 to 2016, China's unemployment rates were far below those of India and the United States. Starting in 2017, China's percentage of unemployment then started to grow larger than the United States. In 2022 and 2023, China's unemployment percentile has surpassed those of both India and the United States. However, the gap of percentage of employment between the three countries studied is much less extreme in recent years compared to 2013, the beginning of this analysis.</p>

  <p>This information is important because it indicates how the largest countries in the world have handled their massive populations in regard to human posterity and labor. As a society, we are constantly looking to improve the quality of life of those around us, and despite unemployment data increasing drastically for China, India, and the United States in 2020 - due to the COVID-19 outbreak - our global society has managed to somewhat decrease the amounts of unemployment despite increasing in population. From a global perspective, our goal is to continue to provide employment opportunities for all people so that we may each have an opportunity to earn a living and provide for ourselves and our families, despite the amount of people living in our country. This data shows positive growth towards the continued goal of genuine prosperity and welfare of our society.</p>

  <p>To describe the population of the three countries, an area chart was used to showcase growth and compare size. To describe the employment rates of the three countries, a bar chart was used to compare fluctuating values regarding the same subject between three different 'factors': China, India, and the United States.</p>
